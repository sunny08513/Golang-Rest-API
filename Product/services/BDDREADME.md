# BDD go testing using ginkgo and gomega

Ginkgo and Gomega are popular testing frameworks for Go, known for their BDD-style (Behavior-Driven Development) approach. Ginkgo provides the structure for writing tests in a descriptive, human-readable manner, while Gomega provides the matchers to express expectations about the behavior of your code.

```
1. BeforeSuite and AfterSuite are used to set up and tear down resources before and after all specs in the suite.
2. BeforeEach and AfterEach are used to set up and tear down resources before and after each spec.
3. Context is used to group related specs, allowing you to set up common behaviors for those specs.
4. Expect is used to set expectations for the behavior of your code.
```

# Install ginkgo and gomega

```
go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get github.com/onsi/gomega
```

Ginkgo and Gomega are two separate libraries that are often used together for testing in Go, especially in the context of BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) style testing. Here's a brief overview of what each library provides:

Ginkgo:
```
BDD Style Testing: Ginkgo allows you to write your tests in a behavior-driven style, using Describe, Context, and It blocks to organize your tests into meaningful units that describe the behavior of your code.

Before and After Hooks: Ginkgo provides BeforeSuite, AfterSuite, BeforeEach, and AfterEach hooks, which allow you to set up and tear down resources before and after tests at different levels of granularity (suite or spec level).

Async Testing: Ginkgo supports asynchronous testing, allowing you to test code that involves channels or timers without blocking the test runner.

Focused and Pending Tests: You can focus on specific tests or mark tests as pending using Ginkgo's FIt, XIt, PIt, and Pending functions.

Parallel Testing: Ginkgo can run tests in parallel to speed up test execution, controlled by the GinkgoConfig.Parallelism configuration.
```
Gomega:
```
Matcher Library: Gomega provides a rich set of matchers that allow you to express expectations about the behavior of your code in a clear and readable way. Matchers include Equal, BeTrue, ContainSubstring, HaveLen, and many more.

Custom Matchers: Gomega allows you to define custom matchers to encapsulate complex or repeated expectations in your tests.

Async Matchers: Gomega's matchers work seamlessly with Ginkgo's async testing features, allowing you to write tests for asynchronous code that are easy to read and maintain.

Failure Messages: Gomega generates informative failure messages when expectations fail, helping you quickly diagnose and fix issues in your code.

In summary, Ginkgo provides the structure and framework for writing BDD-style tests, while Gomega provides the matchers and expectations that make writing those tests expressive and easy to understand.
