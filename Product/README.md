# Golang Mocking

To generate a mock file for an interface in Go, you can use the mockgen tool provided by the golang/mock package. Here's a step-by-step guide to generating a mock file for an interface:

1. First, install the mockgen tool:

```
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@latest
```

2. Create an interface file (let's say service.go) that defines the interface you want to mock:
```
package mypackage

type MyService interface {
    DoSomething() string
}
```

3. Run the mockgen tool to generate the mock file:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin (if needed)
mockgen -destination=mock_interface.go -source=interface.go  -package=packagename
```
This command tells mockgen to generate a mock file (mock_my_service.go) in the mocks package for the MyService interface in the mypackage package.

4. Use the generated mock file in your tests:

```
package mypackage_test

import (
    "testing"

    "mypackage/mocks"
)

func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    mockService := &mocks.MockMyService{}

    // Define the behavior of the mock service
    mockService.On("DoSomething").Return("mocked response")

    // Use the mock service in your test
    result := myFunction(mockService)

    // Assert the result
    if result != "mocked response" {
        t.Errorf("Expected 'mocked response', got '%s'", result)
    }

    // Assert that the method was called
    mockService.AssertCalled(t, "DoSomething")
}
```

In this example, mocks/mock_my_service.go contains the generated mock implementation of the MyService interface, which you can use in your tests to mock the behavior of the DoSomething method.


# Run Go Test
```
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... -v
```

# Check covered code
```
 go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```
